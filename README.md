# SmartHarvest - Optimizer Vault

## Overview

**SmartHarvest** is a decentralized optimizer vault protocol designed to automate yield optimization, diversify risks, and enhance user returns through efficient multi-protocol strategies. The protocol will support automated re-investment of returns, providing users with a seamless experience in managing their investments across multiple decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.

The goal of **SmartHarvest** is to create a smart contract-based vault that allows users to deposit tokens and participate in various DeFi strategies while having their funds automatically re-invested to maximize yield. The vault will use performance-based fee structures to ensure that the protocol aligns with user incentives.

Currently, the protocol is still in development and is being built using **Foundry**, a fast and reliable framework for smart contract testing and deployment on Ethereum and Ethereum-compatible networks.

## Purpose of the Protocol

The primary purpose of **SmartHarvest** is to provide a smart, automated solution for yield farming and investment management. Key functionalities include:

- **Automated Yield Optimization**: The protocol automatically reallocates capital to the highest yielding opportunities within integrated strategies.
- **Multi-Protocol Support**: Users can benefit from returns across multiple DeFi protocols without having to manually track, interact, or reallocate their funds.
- **Risk Diversification**: The vault will spread investments across multiple protocols to reduce risk exposure.
- **Automatic Reinvestment**: Instead of requiring manual harvesting of rewards, SmartHarvest will automatically reinvest yields back into the vault to further grow user balances.

## Final Goal

The final goal of **SmartHarvest** is to become a reliable and secure vault solution that provides users with a hassle-free, fully automated way to earn the best possible yields on their assets, while mitigating risks associated with liquidity farming and DeFi protocols. The vault will continuously optimize yield and ensure that users' funds are put to work in the most efficient way possible.

### Features and Benefits

- **Seamless User Experience**: Users will simply deposit tokens into the vault, and the system will handle all aspects of yield optimization and reinvestment.
- **Diversification and Risk Reduction**: The protocol will aggregate yield across multiple strategies to minimize risks.
- **Performance Fees**: A small performance fee is deducted from the profits generated by the vault, ensuring the protocol remains sustainable while aligning incentives.

## Current Development Phase

**SmartHarvest** is still in the **development phase**. We are currently focusing on the following:

1. **Core Vault Contract**: Implementing the main vault contract that handles deposits, withdrawals, and interaction with external yield-generating protocols.
2. **Automated Reinvestment**: Developing the logic to reinvest earnings and yield from protocols automatically back into the vault.
3. **Multi-Protocol Integration**: Supporting multiple DeFi strategies and protocols to ensure that users' funds are deployed across the best-performing opportunities.

### Ongoing Development

As part of the ongoing development, we are actively working on:

- Enhancing the contractâ€™s security.
- Testing various DeFi integrations.
- Implementing performance fee models and optimizing for gas efficiency.

## Tools and Frameworks Used

- **Foundry**: We are using **Foundry** for smart contract testing and development. Foundry provides a fast and efficient framework for deploying and interacting with smart contracts on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains.
- **Solidity**: All contracts are written in **Solidity**, the programming language for smart contracts on Ethereum.
- **OpenZeppelin**: We are using **OpenZeppelin Contracts** for standard, secure implementations of common contract functionalities (e.g., ERC20, ERC721).
